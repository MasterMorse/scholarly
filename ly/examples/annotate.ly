  Example file for ScholarLY's \annotate functionality.
  This file contains a working example to show a number of features
  of the \annotate package. Play around with the commented configuration
  options and see what they do. The example is also used in the Wiki.

% By default annotations are printed to the console.
% Uncomment the following line to deactivate this
%\printAnnotations ##f

% Activate output of annotations for both plaintext and latex
\setAnnotationExportTargets #'("plaintext" "latex")

% Optionally format timing information using the lilyglyphs LaTeX package
%\useLilyglyphsForBeatString ##t

% By default annotations are colored according to their annotation type
% Uncomment the following line to deactivate this
%\colorAnnotations ##f

% By default annotations are sorted by their rhythmic location
%\sortAnnotationsBy #'("type")

% Customize labelling of affected context
\addAnnotationContextLabels
#'(("left-hand" . "Linke Hand"))

% Configure a custom annotation type by setting some values:

\setAnnotationTypeLabel "custom-annotation" "Custom Annotation:"
\setAnnotationTypeColor "custom-annotation" #darkcyan

% Support custom properties by adding a label
\setAnnotationPropertyLabel "original-pitch" "Original Pitch"

% Arbitrary functions can be called to generate property values.
% It is possible to use define-scheme-function or define-music-function, but the
% function has to return a valid data type for use as property value
% TODO: Can markup functions be used too?
