% 1) If the annotation defines a 'context' property
%    this value is used.
% 2) If the Staff-level context where the annotation
%    is defined is explicitly named this name is used
% 3) Without any explicit naming the directory name of
%    the file in which the annotation is entered is used.
%
% For pretty-printing or localizing \annotate
% supports re-labelling of these context names.

% Initialize empty alist.
